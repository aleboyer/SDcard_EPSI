/* Crystal specific temperature dependent frequency deviation (dF) in Hz.
   The table is in the format:
     dF(T) = crystalCompensationTable[T-T0] / 1000
   i.e. the value of element n is the frequency offset in mHz at n degrees C offset from the crystal's nominal temperature.
   This table is based on the data sheet parameters for the 32.768 kHz crystal on EFM32GG-STK3700, whose
   crystal temperature deviation is given as -0.035 ppm/(degC)^2 */
